# Web-GIS-Dev-Interview-2022
This repo contains technical questions for interviewing web GIS candidates fall 2022

## Instructions

## Python Questions
1.	Find all the Map Services at our USFS public facing EDW ArcGIS REST API
    - Use Python (> 3.0) to get a dictionary of all the Map services available here: [https://apps.fs.usda.gov/arcx/rest/services/EDW/](https://apps.fs.usda.gov/arcx/rest/services/EDW/)
    - The structure of the dictionary returned should be `{â€˜service name': {'type': service type, 'layers': [info from layer attribute]}}`
2.	From the service located here: [https://apps.fs.usda.gov/arcx/rest/services/EDW/EDW_ForestSystemBoundaries_01/MapServer/0](https://apps.fs.usda.gov/arcx/rest/services/EDW/EDW_ForestSystemBoundaries_01/MapServer/0) use Python to
    - Get an array of all the National Forests whose name starts with the letter `S`.
    - Get the count, as an integer, of all the National forests greater than 100,000 acres.
    
## JS/HTML/CSS - Use the sample starter in this project repo
1.  Write a CSS selector to find all divs whose CSS class is `container`.
2.	Modify above selector to find all divs whose CSS class is `container` that is also a child of a div with CSS class `header`.
3.	Modify above selector to find all the same divs that also have CSS class `enabled`.
4.  Follow the developer docs on the [ArcGIS API for JS 4.x Get Started page](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/get-started/) to accomplish the following:
    - Add a map to the page and set its height to 80% and width to fullscreen 
    - Center the map at the coordinates of the USFS Geospatial Technology Applications Center (GTAC) in Salt Lake City (approximate location is fine)
5.  Assume you have a JS array of objects (structured as shown below). Add code in the `script.js` file to returns an array of people whose age is less than 50 and is not null. Log the resulting names to the console.
`const people = [{'name': 'Derek', 'age':38}, {'name': 'Erich', 'age':59},{'name': 'Kim', 'age':38},{'name': 'Sean', 'age': null}];`
5.	In the same `script.js` file, add code to iterate over each of those divs and output their ID properties to the console.
6.  Use CSS and the existing structure to make the navigation links in the site header follow a responsive design. The links should be listed horizontally for large screens and should appear stacked vertically on screens with width <800px (kudos will be given for extra style points).
